Title: Function Composition
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2023-11-27
Description: A function composition operator to chain a series of calls into a single function, mimicking the math notion of (f o g o h)(x) = h(g(f(x))). Inspired by 'pipeOp' ('|>') since R4.1 and 'magrittr pipe' ('%>%'), the operator build a pipe without putting data through, which is best for anonymous function accepted by utilities such as apply() and lapply().
